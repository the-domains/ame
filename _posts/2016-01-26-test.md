AME Cloud Ventures is the venture fund led by Jerry Yang, co-founder of Yahoo! 
AME Cloud Ventures focuses on seed to later stage companies building infrastructure and value chains around data. We love technology heavy companies gathering or creating unique data at every stage of the data stack --- from infrastructure all the way to applications, mobile, and sensors. 
We believe great people are the key to a company's success. We strive to find, fund, and support true entrepreneurs. We provide a unique and genuine set of resources to our founding teams, from strong operational and business experience, to networks of amazing mentors and international partners, particularly China.
